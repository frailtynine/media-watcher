        There’s no missing minute in Epstein jail tape: CBS
        Turns out, if CBS sources are correct, Trump administration has
        lied about this tape. According to Pam Bondi, there’s a missing minute
        at 11:49 pm on the night of Jeffrey Epstein death due to
        camera reset protocol.

        Government sources say it’s bullshit, and all the officials
        have the original, unedited, video.

        What’s happening during this minute is unknown.
        But the pressure to release more Epstein materials is growing on Trump.

        that will inform users about the crypto prices in relation to the
        market and include a call to action to check the market on Futurum.

        For example, if the price is close to the market condition within 2-3%,
        you can suggest a post that highlights this fact and encourages users
        to check the market on Futurum. If the market is closing within
        12-16 hours, the post suggestion is necessary.

        Bear in mind that the analyst will not see the prompt or the rules.
